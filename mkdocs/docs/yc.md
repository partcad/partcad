## My top ten pieces of advice for preparing for a YC Interview, good luck!

- Interview is 10 minutes long and goes fast – practice and time yourself
- The focus will be on Team, Market, and Traction
- Most answers should be no longer than 20–30 seconds – follow-up questions will come
- Don’t try to demo first thing – demos are usually in the second half of the interview
- Founders shouldn’t talk over each other or contradict each other
- The first question is “what do you do” – have a great 30-second answer that covers what you do with an example. This
  is the hardest and most impactful question – AVOID JARGON – your mom and dad should be able to understand what you do
  from this answer.
- There are websites with sample interview questions – google them and practice
- Questions will be rapid fire – you won’t be able to control the direction of the interview – just roll with it :)
- When you intro yourselves in the beginning be clear about which founders does business and which does tech
- If there are any red flag/weak points for your startup be ready to answer a question about them with clear 15-second
  answers. Be prepared but don’t dwell on the bad.

## Tips for YC Interviews

_We are in the midst of YC interviews right now and I had a few bits of advice for interviewees that I thought I’d
publish while they are still top of mind (in no particular order): _

1. Don’t use buzzwords. Speak in plain language.
2. Have a conversation with us. Don’t deliver a prewritten “pitch.”
3. Sometimes we’ll want to see a demo, but most often we just want to talk about what you’re doing. If you rely on a
   demonstration to explain what you’re doing, that’s a bad sign. Being able to explain something in words shows you
   really understand it.
4. Relax (I know this is easier said than done). We want you to do well! And we are very expert by now at overlooking
   the little things that go wrong in interviews.
5. We love learning new things. And a good startup idea usually teaches you something when you encounter it. Don’t worry
   if the new things about your idea are things only someone in your field would care about. We like that. We’d rather
   have interesting details than boring generalizations.
6. We don’t have lots of time for pleasantries, unfortunately. We have a fixed amount of time and we want to spend it
   learning about you and your idea. So please don’t take it personally if we jump right into things.
7. There’s no one specific set type of interview. They can go in many different directions. So don’t worry if the
   interview doesn’t take the form you expected.
