Join us and bring the word to the world!

You can also make a huge impact on lots of people by simply creating a simple post
or a basic video tutorial. It is very much appreciated.

PartCAD Public Repository
=========================

Besides main PartCAD software components, you can contrinute to the community by publishing design data
as well as pluggable software modules to PartCAD Public Repository.

Assemblies
----------

Migrate your products to PartCAD by creating and publishing Assembly YAML files
for your products. Eliminate the need to develop and maintain a custom way to
store and to publish assembly instructions and bills of materials.
Enable the use or your assemblies in other PartCAD projects.

Start by creating a package (in a dedicated git repository)
for all products by your company or community.
Then add parametrized assembly declarations to the package.

The best way to write Assembly YAML files is to use PartCAD VS Code extension
and use code completion features: select the part you want to add in the
explorer view on the left and, then,
start typing '- part: ' in the Assembly YAML file editor as if you were to add
a new part to the assembly. After you typed "- pa", a code completion suggestion
will show up, offering to add the complete YAML block which adds the selected
part to the assembly.

Parts
-----

Publish your parts in the PartCAD Public Repository to enable their use (and
purchase if applicable) by other PartCAD users.

Start by creating a package (in a dedicated git repository)
for all parts and assemblies created by your company
or community, if you didn't do that yet.
Then add part declarations to the package.

If CAD files already exist for these parts, then you should probably start by
using those CAD files first. You can always migrate to Code-CAD technologies
(such as OpenSCAD, CadQuery or build123d) later. However you might want to host
the CAD files separately from the package's git repository
(and have PartCAD fetch them using `fileFrom: url`,
even if they are hosted in another git repository)
so that you do not blow up the repository size and
slow your projects down in perpetuity by a temporary use of legacy CAD files.

After that declare the location of ports.
This will enable connecting parts to each other, instead of placing them using
absolute and relative coordinates and ensuring they remain properly co-located
using finger-crossing guarantees.
Whenever possible, use interfaces and mating declarations insteaf of pure ports,
so that it's easier for PartCAD (including AIs using PartCAD) to determine
which parts are meant to be connected to which parts, and how exactly they need
to be connected.

Interfaces
----------

The most challenging step of adding parts is to declare all the ports.
This effort can be significantly reduced for all PartCAD users globally
by extending the library of standard interfaces.

Does your part have a port of the kind also found in many other parts?
Consider declaring a reusable interface.

Providers
---------

Advertise your online store and manufacturing services by integrating your API
with PartCAD.

Decide which one is more appropriate for your business:
``store`` or ``manufacturer``. Then see an existing provider implementation of
that kind as a reference. Alternatively, reach out to the PartCAD team to get
help with the implementation. Be at the forefront of the next industrial
revolution together with PartCAD!

Help a Friend
-------------

Do you know an opensource project that maintains assembly instructions or doing
something else that can be radically improved by using PartCAD?
Do you know a business that uses legacy tools and struggles to scale
collaboration in the era of Git?
Do you know a local additive manufacturing shop that can use more local
customers?
Do you know a collection of parts that the community can really benefit from if
only these parts and corresponding assembly ideas were easily discoverable?

Help them migrate to PartCAD!

How to contrbute?
*****************

.. _Environment:

Environment
===========

Our team is using `Visual Studio Code`_ and `Docker`_ which boosts
software development by providing a powerful, customizable editor and ensuring consistent environments with
containerization.

VS Code's rich extensions and debugging tools integrate seamlessly with Docker, allowing developers to write, test, and
debug code within containers.

This setup eliminates environment inconsistencies, accelerates development, and improves team collaboration.

Docker
------

`Docker`_ helps build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or
management. There are two main options how to setup Docker.

If you do not have previous experience with Docker, then here is good place to start:

- `Docker Docs - Get Started`_

Engine
------

If your primary development system is Linux then you can install Docker daemon directly on your host, see `Install`_ for
more details on how to install it in the distribution you're using. Minimum required versions:

- Docker Engine: v27.4.0 or higher
- Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows: 4.37.1 or higher

.. note::

    *`Docker Engine`_ is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications.
    Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:*

    - A server with a long-running daemon process `dockerd`_.
    - APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
    - A command line interface (CLI) client `Docker`_.

    The CLI uses `Docker APIs`_ to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands.
    Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as
    images, containers, networks, and volumes.

    For more details, see `Docker Architecture`_.

Desktop
-------

If you're working on macOS or Windows, you can still install Engine, but that would require managing a local Linux VM.
Docker Desktop provides a convenient solution and handles the required virtualization for you:

- `Install on Mac`_
- `Install on Windows`_

.. note::

    *`Docker Desktop` is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that lets you build,
    share, and run containerized applications and microservices.*

Visual Studio Code
==================

VS Code available for macOS, Linux, and Windows, has extensible architecture and has rich customization and integration
options. Here is good place to get familiar with it:

- `Setting up Visual Studio Code`_

.. note::

    *Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense
    code completion and debugging.*

    *First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle
    means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.*

.. image:: images/vs-code-behave.png
  :width: 80%
  :align: center
  :alt: A screenshot of a Visual Studio Code environment. The terminal window shows a behave command being executed to test BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenarios for a PartCAD project.

Dev Containers
--------------

VS Code also provides seamless integration with Docker for managing environments by supporting `Dev Containers`_
specification.

.. note::

    _The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment.
    It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full
    feature set. A `devcontainer.json`_ file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development
    container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate
    tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase._

Following docs section provides good overview of available features:

Quick Start
===========

.. note::

  Following tutorial assumes that you have previous experience with both `VS Code`_ and `Docker`_ or have read
  `Environment`_ first.

Overall process starting from setting up environment till merging changes in default branch is the following:

1. Clone Git Repository.
2. Install Python Dependencies.
3. Activate Virtual Environment.
4. Make Changes in Source Files.
5. Run Tests.
6. Commit & Push Changes.
7. Open Pull Request.
8. Meet PR Merge Criteria.

Retrieve the Source Code
------------------------

Due to variations in Docker setup across operating systems, this step has distinct best practices. Please follow the
section for your OS below. Once you have cloned the repository, VS Code will start the Dev Container.

The last time we've measured, the size of base Docker Image with all system-level dependencies baked in is 2.83 GB, main highlights are:

- APT Packages: 770.56 MB
- Git: 423.87 MB
- Python: 411.28 MB
- Common Utils: 251.11 MB
- Debian (Bookwork): 116.56 MB

Mac & Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. warning::

    Since macOS and Windows run containers in a VM, "`bind`_" mounts are not as fast as using the container's filesystem
    directly. Fortunately, Docker has the concept of a local "`named volume`_" that can act like the container's
    filesystem but survives container rebuilds. This makes it ideal for storing package folders like ``node_modules``,
    data folders, or output folders like ``build`` where write performance is critical.

  In order to have optimal performance use the following documentation, but when prompted to provide GitHub repository
  name use ``partcad/partcad`` to clone our main repository:

  - `Open a Git repository or GitHub PR in an isolated container volume`_

Linux
^^^^^

  Since Linux can run Docker Engine directly on your host system, you can use the following documentation to bootstrap
  environment.

  - `Open an existing folder in a container`_

Install Dependencies
--------------------

We are using `Poetry`_ to manage dependencies and virtual environments.

.. note::

    Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your
    project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable
    installs, and can build your project for distribution.

Once the Dev Container is started, open a shell session in the Terminal view of VS Code. The current working directory
will be ``/workspaces/partcad`` containing the source files. To install Python packages, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ poetry install

It will create virtual environment in ``.venv/`` directory and download about 1.5 GB dependencies. Once all dependencies
are downloaded Poetry will also install current package in editable mode, and you will see the following:

.. code-block::

  Installing the current project: partcad-dev (0.7.135)

Activate Environment
--------------------

In order to update your ``$PATH`` and be able to run commandline tools such as ``pytest`` you need to activate virtual
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ poetry shell

or

.. code-block:: bash

  $ $(poetry env activate)

After that you will be able to run ``pc``, for example ``pc version``, which will output something along the lines:

.. code-block::

  INFO:  PartCAD Python Module version: 0.7.40
  INFO:  PartCAD CLI version: 0.7.40

Make Changes
------------

Make the changes through Visual Studio Code how you would do for any other project.

Manual Tests
------------

To test functionality of the Python core module, use corresponding command line interface (CLI) commands.

To test CLI functionality, simply type commands in a shell session in the Terminal view of the VSCode where the development takes place.

To test VSCode plugin, run the following commands in a shell session in the Terminal view before restarting the VSCode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd partcad-ide-vscode
    $ nox --session setup
    $ nox --session build_package
    $ code --install-extension partcad.vsix

To test the Python core module using the VSCode plugin, click the `Restart PartCAD` icon in the PartCAD's `Context` view after each change.

.. note::

  If you are developing inside the PartCAD Dev container using PartCAD VSCode extension, and are seeing this:

  .. code-block:: text

      ERROR: Failed to clone repo https://github.com/openvmp/partcad-index.git after 0 retries

  then you are likely to have Git configured to use SSH creds to access GitHub,
  while the SSH creds are not available in the Dev container.

  This could be fixed by running ``ssh-add`` on the host
  and confirmed by running ``ssh-add -l`` inside the container.

To test documentation changes, run the following command before navigating your favorite VSCode browser extension to `./docs/build/html`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sphinx-build -M html docs/source docs/build -n -W

Alternatively, run the following command before navigating your favorite VSCode browser extension to `127.0.0.1:8000`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sphinx-autobuild --host 127.0.0.1 -b html docs/source docs/build

Automated Tests
---------------

Pytest
^^^^^^

PartCAD uses ``pytest`` for unit testing, where a particular piece of code or feature is tested.

If you `activated virtual environment`_ you can just run ``pytest`` from a bash session in the Terminal view of VSCode.

You can also use VS Code's built-in **Testing** integration to run and debug tests via the UI. To set this up:

1. Open the Command Palette (``Ctrl+Shift+P`` or ``Cmd+Shift+P``)
2. Run ``Python: Select Interpreter``
3. Select ``('.venv': Poetry) .venv/bin/python`` from the list

You also can run ``pytest`` without activating environment via Poetry, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run pytest

The tests for the core module are located in the ``./partcad/tests`` directory.
The tests for the CLI module are located in the ``./partcad-cli/tests`` directory.
The tests for the LSP server of VSCode plugin are located in the ``./partcad-ide-vscode/src/test/python_tests`` directory.

Behave
^^^^^^

PartCAD uses ``behave`` for integration testing, where a part of the system is tested as a whole.

To run tests using ``behave``, execute the following command in an activated environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ behave

Feature definitions and step implementations are located in the ``./features`` directory.

Commit & Push Changes
---------------------

You can commit changes from either terminal or VS Code UI which will trigger local git hooks managed by ``pre-commit`` to
enforce coding standards and catch some of the problems early.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    `pre-commit`_ is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

Configuration file is located at ``.devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml`` where you can see all supported hooks.

In rare cases, you might need to temporarily disable hooks. There are two options:

1. Use `temporarily disable hooks`_ to skip specific individual hooks
2. Use `git commit --no-verify`_ to skip all hooks at once

Remember: These hooks are required to pass in CI before PR merge.

.. warning::

    While you can remove local git hooks completely, be aware that:
    1. Your PR will be blocked from merging until all hook checks pass in CI
    2. You'll miss early feedback that could prevent CI failures
    3. You may need to make additional commits to fix issues that hooks would have caught locally

    Option 1: Using pre-commit (recommended)

    .. code-block:: bash

      # To remove hooks:
      pre-commit uninstall --config .devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      # To restore hooks later:
      pre-commit install --config .devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml

    Option 2: Manual removal (use with caution):

    .. code-block:: bash

      # Make sure you're in the right directory first
      if [ -d ".git/hooks" ]; then
        # Backup hooks first
        mkdir -p .git/hooks_backup
        mv .git/hooks/* .git/hooks_backup/
        echo "Hooks backed up to .git/hooks_backup/"
      else
        echo "Error: .git/hooks directory not found"
      fi

Open Pull Request
-----------------

There are multiple options how PR could be opened, please refer to the following to choose option which works best for
you.

- `Creating a pull request`_
- `GitHub Pull Requests in Visual Studio Code`_

Meet PR Merge Criteria
----------------------

Depending on files changed in PR you might need to get required checks to pass first and get reviews from owners or
maintainers, following are related GH docs:

- `About Status Checks`_
- `Required reviews`_

Implementation Details
----------------------

The following information is useful for PartCAD contributors.

.. _location:

Coordinates / Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PartCAD uses OpenCASCADE Location objects (TopLoc_Location) to represent locations of objects in 3D space.

.. code-block:: javascript

    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 70]

The above list represents a location with the following components:

1. ``[1, 2, 3]``: Translation or offset (in millimeters) along the X, Y, and Z axes
2. ``[4, 5, 6]``: The X, Y and Z sizes of the vector to rotate around
3. ``70``: The angle of rotation around the above vector


Internal geometry representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PartCAD maintains parts as OpenCASCADE objects. Similar to ``wrapped`` objects found
in ``CadQuery`` and ``build123d``.

Parallelism
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Asynchronous at heart

  PartCAD is designed to run most of its logic as coroutines in the asyncio's event loop.

2. Threads for the muscle

  There is a separate thread pool created for long-running procedures that are CPU intensive.
  The number of threads matches the number of CPU cores minus 1 (if there is more than 1).

  Coroutines can spawn tasks on the thread pool. Tasks on the thread pool can't call coroutines that use asyncio.Lock().

3. Digest external code properly

  Separate processes are spawned (optionally, in a sandboxed environment) to process third-party CAD-as-code parts and assemblies.
  One thread is consumed in the thread pool to wait for each such process to complete (to cap the number of CPU cores occupied).

4. Friendly face

  To make it apparent to external users, all externally visible coroutines have names that end with "_async".
  Each such coroutine is accompanied by a synchronous wrapper (which does not have "_async" in its name).
