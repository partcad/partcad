PartCAD

`PartCAD <https://github.com/partcad/partcad>`_ is the standard for documenting manufacturable physical products. It comes with a set of tools to maintain
product information and to facilitate efficient and effective workflows at all product lifecycle phases.

PartCAD is more than just a traditional CAD tool for drawing. In fact, it’s **not for drawing at all**. The letters
“CAD” in PartCAD stand for “computer-aided design” in a more generic sense, where “design” stands for the process of
getting from an idea to **a clear and deterministic specification of a manufacturable physical product** using a
computer (including the use of AI models). While PartCAD started as **the first package manager for hardware**, it is
now the **next-generation CAD** that can turn a single visionary individual into a one person corporation, or make one
future Product Manager as productive (**and much faster!**) as 10 corporate engineering departments of the past.
