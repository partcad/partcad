# Welcome

[PartCAD] is **the first package manager for CAD models** and a framework for managing assemblies.

It aims to complement Git with everything necessary for hardware development to substitute commercial Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM) tools.

It's a free versioning and change management solution for all your CAD needs, built around your CAD artifacts instead of
being built into your CAD tool:
