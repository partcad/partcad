[PartCAD] is **the first package manager for CAD models** and a framework for managing assemblies.

It aims to complement Git with everything necessary for hardware development to substitute commercial Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM) tools. It's a free versioning and change management solution for all your CAD needs, built around your
CAD artifacts instead of being built into your CAD tool.

## Installation

Note, it's not required but highly recommended that you have [conda] installed. If you experience any difficulty
installing or using any PartCAD tool, then make sure to install [conda].

### Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension can be installed by searching for `PartCAD` in the VS Code extension search form, or by browsing
[its VS Code marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OpenVMP.partcad).

Make sure to have Python configured and a [conda] environment set up in VS Code before using PartCAD.

### Command-Line Interface

The recommended method to install PartCAD CLI tools for most users is:

```shell
pip install -U partcad-cli
```

- On **Windows**, install `Miniforge3` using `Register Miniforge3 as my default Python X.XX` and use this Python
  environment for PartCAD. Also set `LongPathsEnabled` to 1 at
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem` using `Registry Editor`.
- On **Ubuntu**, try `apt install libcairo2-dev python3-dev` if `pip install` fails to install `cairo`.
- On **macOS**, make sure XCode and command lines tools are installed. Also, use `mamba` should you experience
  difficulties on macOS with the ARM architecture.

### PartCAD development

Refer to the [Quick Start] guide for step-by-step instructions on setting up your development environment, adding
features, and running tests.
